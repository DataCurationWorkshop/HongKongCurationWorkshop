## 2. From the OAIS to the Data Lifecycle

While many curatorial steps _can_ take place long after a dataset's original point of creation or collection, data curation is generally more effective when conducted as an on-going process.  As the DCC writes, 

>It is a common misconception that data is created or captured and then passed on to someone else to curate. In fact, much of the most crucial information required for effective long-term curation and reuse must be captured at the conceptualisation and collection stages. 

-[from the DCC FAQ](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/curation-lifecycle-model/lifecycle-model-faqs#sthash.I5US5DyT.dpuf)

Lifecycle models are a way of atomizing data collection, use, analysis and preservation into component stages, and then identifying individual curatorial tasks that can or should be completed at each point. 

There are numerous lifecycle models; for this workshop we'll focus on two of the more popular general models, one from the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) and one from Data One, and one domain-specific model from the SBDC project at the University of Illinois.

## 2.1 OAIS Reference Model

Created by Consultive Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) for use with space data, the OAIS Reference Model has been widely adapted by a broad range of non-space agencies as a general model of a preservation system for both analog and digital data objects.

The OAIS Reference Model provides information professionals with a conceptual framework of a preservation system, as well as a vocabulary of "terms that are not already overloaded with meaning so as to reduce conveying unintended meanings".  In particular, it contributes the idea of the different information packages that are processed at different points during preservation work:
	- the SIP, or submitted information package
	- the AIP, or archival informaition package
	- and the DIP, or dissemination information package

Preservation activities are prioritized according to the needs of a "designated community" of users.
 
## 2.2 The DCC Lifecycle Model

The DCC model divides curatorial tasks into three interlinked categories, all of which are (quite literally) centered around data:

**Full lifecycle actions**

These are actions that continue throughout the lifespan[link to lifecycle def in introduction] of a dataset, and require on-going attention from the curator.  [See more](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/curation-lifecycle-model#sthash.QOx0GL9t.dpuf)

We'll talk more about these activities in coming sessions.

**Occasional actions**

These actions may need to be done repeatedly, but only every once in a while. [See more](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/curation-lifecycle-model#sthash.Iq4isJfb.dpuf)

**Sequential actions**

These actions mirror the general workflow of research, and each stage entails specific curatorial tasks.  [See more](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/curation-lifecycle-model#sthash.Iq4isJfb.dpuf)

Note that in the DCC model, the majority of work with data _prior_ to it's existence in an archive or repository takes place within the "Conceptualise" and "Create or Receive" stages.  While this may make the DCC Model particularly relevant for academic librarians and data curators, it does make it more less relevant to curators and researchers seeking to push curatorial activities "upstream" in the overall research process (see Wallis et al, 2008 for further explanation on the necessity of this).  The Data One and SBDC models presented below attempt to integrate curatorial and research activities a bit more holistically.

## 2.2 The Data One Model

The Data One model is considerably simpler than the DCC model, and consists of 8 sequential, but continuous, stages:

Many of these stages are similar to the sequential steps described by the DCC model -- however we do note that the Data ONE model is intended to be viewed through the perspective of an independent researcher or research team undertaking curatorial tasks on their own or in occasional collaboration with a data center or archiving service. Consequently, many of the recommendations are aimed at researchers rather than LIS practitioners. 

## 2.3 SBDC Workflow for Geobiology: Workflow documentation as a curatorial tool

The Site-Based Data Curation (SBDC) project at the University of Illinois has been developing a framework of policies and best practices for the curation of digital research data collected from _scientifically significant sites_, using the interdisciplinary field of geobiology as an initial case study. We have found that extremely detailed workflow documentation can help practitioners identify important curatorial "points of intervention", or stages within a research project, at which data products must be captured for later sharing and reuse.

Thus, rather than aiming to create an idealized lifecycle model applicable to all fields of scholarship (as in the DCC and DataOne models do), we have created an extremely domain- (or even project-) specific workflow, that fully expresses the specificities unique to a particular kind of research.  We believe that the creation of domain- or project-specific workflows can be helpful curatorial tools in cases in which practitioners are working extensively with researchers from one scholarly domain, or one research team.

In this example, we worked extensively with Bruce Fouke, a geobiologist and co-PI of our project, to first inventory all data products (e.g. digital data such as spreadsheets, databases, gene sequences, field notes, field photographs, and more) from one field project, and then document a) how those data products were created, and b) how those data products were interlinked. The SBDC team's later work curating those data products was also identified.

The resulting workflow has 6 stages: Planning, Fieldwork, Processing & Analysis, Data Assessment, Standardizing and Packaging.

While these aren't substantially different from the DCC or Data One models, we do note our inclusion of and emphasis on field work (or data collection) as its own stage.  Further,
we have tried to show the dependencies between different data products produced at different stages of research and curation:

Though this initial workflow is specific to the field of geobiology -- and indeed, Dr. Fouke's particular field practices -- we are working with other researchers in other fields to document their research and curation workflows as well, and we hope that the resulting workflows can be altered and used by others.  We will discuss the workflow documentation process further in today's lab session.
