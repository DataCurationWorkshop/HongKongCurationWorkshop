#“Data Curation Life Cycles and Tools”

ILO's:

1. Improve understanding of and familiarity with data curation life cycles
2. Gain hands-on experience with developing data management plans associated with sponsored projects, with an eye toward risk and sustainability
3. Learn to select and assess data management tools and repository systems for different disciplines for the purpose of sharing collections

#Outline

0. Introduction (20 min, NW)
1. Archives and Records Management for Data Curation (maybe move to 4)?
2. Review of lifecycle models (DCC, DataOne... , workflows from the SBDC project?) (20 min, AT)
3. Making the lifecycle actionable (Checklists, Curation Profiles, Significant Properties) (20 Min, AT)
4. Making the lifecycle actionable: the importance of stable identifiers (NW)
5. Preview of Tools to be used in afternoon labs (AT)- Any preview of afternoon case study?

## 2. The Data Lifecycle

While many curatorial steps _can_ take place long after data's original creation or collection, curation is generally more effective when conducted as an on-going process.  As the DCC says, 

>It is a common misconception that data is created or captured and then passed on to someone else to curate. In fact, much of the most crucial information required for effective long-term curation and reuse must be captured at the conceptualisation and collection stages. [- DCC FAQ](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/curation-lifecycle-model/lifecycle-model-faqs#sthash.I5US5DyT.dpuf)

Lifecycle models present us with a way of atomizing data collection, use, analysis and preservation into component stages, and then identifying individual curatorial tasks that can or should be completed at each point.

There are numerous lifecycle models; for this workshop we'll focus on two of the more popular general models, from the DCC and Data One, and one domain-specific model from the SBDC project at Illinois.

## 2.1 The DCC Lifecycle Model

The DCC model divides curatorial tasks into three interlinked categories, all of which are (quite literally) centered around data:

#### Full lifecycle actions: 

These are actions that are on-going throughout the "lifespan" of a dataset, and require on-going attention from the curator.  These tasks include,

>**Preservation Planning**
Plan for preservation throughout the curation lifecycle of digital material. This would include plans for management and administration of all curation lifecycle actions.

>**Community Watch and Participation**
Maintain a watch on appropriate community activities, and participate in the development of shared standards, tools and suitable software. 

>**Curate and Preserve**
Be aware of, and undertake management and administrative actions planned to promote curation and preservation throughout the curation lifecycle.

>**Description and Representation Information**
Assign administrative, descriptive, technical, structural and preservation metadata, using appropriate standards, to ensure adequate description and control over the long-term. Collect and assign representation information required to understand and render both the digital material and the associated metadata.

We'll talk more about these activities in coming sessions.

#### Occasional actions: 

These actions include disposal, reappraisal and migration of data

#### Sequential actions:  

These actions mirror the general workflow of research, and each stage entails specific curatorial tasks.  We'll go into further detail on these tasks today.
