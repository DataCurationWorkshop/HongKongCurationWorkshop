#“Data Curation Life Cycles and Tools” *[intro and overview of data curation]*

ILO's:

1. Improve understanding of and familiarity with data curation life cycles
2. Gain hands-on experience with developing data management plans associated with sponsored projects, with an eye toward risk and sustainability
3. Learn to select and assess data management tools and repository systems for different disciplines for the purpose of sharing collections

#Outline

1. Review of lifecycle models (DCC, DataOne... , workflows from the SBDC project?)
2. Significant properties: identifying important data products and properties
3. Preview of Tools to be used in afternoon labs

- DMP Tool
- Curation Profiles forms?
- ~~Data Up?~~ This has been discontinued for now, and CDL is in the process of merging it with DASH -- they suggest Morpho as a replacement for scientific data: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#tools
