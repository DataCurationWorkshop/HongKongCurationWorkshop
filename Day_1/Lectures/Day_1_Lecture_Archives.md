# Archives and Records Management for Data Curation

Central to the enterprise of archiving and records management is the idea of a "record" - defined as "data or information fixed on some medium which has content, context, and structure" (AAA, 2014). The archival definition of a record then is very close to how we think about data playing an information role within scholarly communities. In future sessions we will talk about the context and structure of digital data in curation, but for this section we want to focus on how three concepts from archives and records management are applied to data curation: 

1. Provenance, and the "chain of custody" 
2. The "records continuum" and the "data continuum"

Cliff Lynch has descried in detail, the difficult role that the scholarly record faces in a digitally networked environment - namely that issues of reliability, authenticity, and continued meaningful access are complicated by the distributed nature of digital artifacts, including data (1994). These issues have been at the center of archives and records management for many decades, and so being able to draw on the knowledge, and the tools developed by this community will be useful in your own institutional data curation initiatives.
