# Data Curation Toolkits and the DMP Tool

In this lab, we'll review Purdue's Data Curation Toolkit, and the California Digital Library's Data Management Planning Tool.  

##Curation Profile Toolkit

>“A Data Curation Profile is a tool that can be used to provide a foundational base of information about a particular set of data that may be curated by an academic library or other institution.” (Carlson and Witt, 2010) 

Developed jointly by Purdue University and the University of Illinois, the toolkit is a generalizable worksheet and interview guide for libraries, cultural heritage instituions and non-profits. The toolkit acts as a guide for a curator or librarian in their collaborations with researchers. 

Guidelines for authors: [http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/dcp/guidelines.html](http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/dcp/guidelines.html)

Because we do not have any researchers to interview, instead we'll be assessing and creating profiles for two public datasets:

- Page-Level Genre Metadata for English-Language Volumes in HathiTrust, 1700-1922: [link to data](http://figshare.com/articles/Page_Level_Genre_Metadata_for_English_Language_Volumes_in_HathiTrust_1700_1922/1279201
http://figshare.com/articles/) - [link to further documentation](Understanding_Genre_in_a_Collection_of_a_Million_Volumes_Interim_Report/1281251)
- Hong Kong 2011 population census: [main tables](http://www.gov.hk/en/theme/psi/datasets/2011cmaintables.htm) - [district profiles](http://www.gov.hk/en/theme/psi/datasets/2011cdistrictprofiles.htm)

Some of these datasets should be available on your desktop; others can be navigated to through your web browser.

##Data Management Planning Tool

Developed by California Digital Libraries, the DMPTool is an interactive templating tool to help researchers and librarians create data management plans.  You will need to create a user profile to log in.
