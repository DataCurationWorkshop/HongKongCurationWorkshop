## Data Publication

What does it mean to "publish" data? 

Most datasets aren't "published" in a journal like a research article, so referring to the act of making data discoverable, attributable, and well described as "publishing" seems to perpetuate a relationship between publishers and libraries that may not be necessary (Parsons and Fox, 2012). 

In this session we will look at the various ways that data publication can be achieved. Some models of data publication include papers written to describe a dataset (e.g. a "data paper") while others refer to the host of activities required to make data available through online portals, webpages, or data archives.
