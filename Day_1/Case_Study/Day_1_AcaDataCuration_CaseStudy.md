# Research Data Management in Academic Libraries

In this session we will use a case study method that been used extensively in the academic data curation space. For example, an early ARL (Association of Research Libraries in the USA) report used the case study approach to compare six academic libraries that were expanding their capacity to service eScience research initiatives, including data-intensive efforts in astronomy, molecular biology, and seismic engineering (Soehner, Steeves & Ward 2010). 

Later case study research has focused on the development of research data management services (RDM) at universities as they respond to federal mandates in data management planning (Raboin, Reznik-Zellenk, and Salo, 2012). The most recent set of data curation case studies were offered by a group at the University of Michigan that concentrated specifically on the "prominent role of the library in providing services to educate and assist researchers with managing data before, during, and after their research projects" (Akers et al. 2014). 

We will review two case studies as a group:

-  [Johns Hopkins University](http://dmp.data.jhu.edu/)
-  [Pennsylvania State University](http://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/groups/rdmst.html) and their innovative [scholar sphere](https://scholarsphere.psu.edu/)

In a breakout session we will review five different additional cases: 

-  [Cornell University](http://data.research.cornell.edu/)
-  [Emory University](http://edc.library.emory.edu/content/online-analysis)
-  [Purdue University](https://www.lib.purdue.edu/researchdata) and [D2C2](http://d2c2.lib.purdue.edu/)
-  [University of Michigan](http://www.lib.umich.edu/research-data-services)
-  [University of Virginia](http://data.library.virginia.edu/)

(note: we will also cover the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign) in greater detail on Day 3): 

For each institution try to answer the following questions: 

- Where are the research data services located (i.e. IT department, University Library, collaboration between different units, etc.)?
- When did research data services begin at this institution? What was the motivation?
- What types of services are offered, by whom and for whom?
- What is the cost recovery / charge for these services? Are they offered free? 
- What institutional repository (IR) options are available for archiving data? What software do these systems use? Can you find any supporting documents for those systems? Do these IRs have any accreditation or auditing documentation available publicly?
