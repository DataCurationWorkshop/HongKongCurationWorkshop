Meeting with Heidi: 

She recommends that we should address researcher motivation for participating in data management / curation activities - a question she has received often from other librarians. 

Value added by institution has to be beyond 'DMP' or a teaching resource... 

She is perfectly fine with us cutting down her slides, and using them for a presentation. 

The plan is for her to call in on Friday (Thursday in IL) at 10:00 AM (8 PM IL) for a round of Q & A. We can seed some questions but should ask participants ahead of time what they would like to ask Dr. Imker. 

Next steps

- cut down her slides
- make an appointment to meet with her about that presentation  

Nic + JSD debrief: 

Thing to supplement in her slides: 

1. How much did IL invest in this? 
2. What are perceived $ amount in return, etc. (Look to planning docs from UIUC)
3. Add in job descriptions that UIUC created.
