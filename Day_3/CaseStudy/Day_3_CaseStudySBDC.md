## Process modeling for Geobiology: Workflow documentation as a curatorial tool

The Site-Based Data Curation (SBDC) project at the University of Illinois has been developing a framework of policies and best practices for the curation of digital research data collected from _scientifically significant sites_, using the interdisciplinary field of geobiology as an initial case study. We have found that extremely detailed workflow documentation can help practitioners identify important curatorial "points of intervention", or stages within a research project, at which data products must be captured for later sharing and reuse.

Thus, rather than aiming to create an idealized lifecycle model applicable to all fields of scholarship (as in the DCC and DataOne models do), we have created an extremely domain- (or even project-) specific workflow, that fully expresses the specificities unique to a particular kind of research.  We believe that the creation of domain- or project-specific workflows can be helpful curatorial tools in cases in which practitioners are working extensively with researchers from one scholarly domain, or one research team.

In this example, we worked extensively with Bruce Fouke, a geobiologist and co-PI of our project, to first inventory all data products (e.g. digital data such as spreadsheets, databases, gene sequences, field notes, field photographs, and more) from one field project, and then document a) how those data products were created, and b) how those data products were interlinked. The SBDC team's later work curating those data products was also identified.

The resulting workflow has 6 stages: Planning, Fieldwork, Processing & Analysis, Data Assessment, Standardizing and Packaging. 

### How to Read This Diagram 

The panels below represent different stages of research and curatorial work; each colored box corresponds to similarly colored documents and data products below. 

Each box with a red border represents a curatorial point of intervention identified through our work.

#### Key documents and data products

Each data product or sample is linked to its parent data products by arrows. 

Each element with < pointed corners > represents a standard, protocol or best practice.  

##### SBDC Minimum Information Guidelines
In consultation with geobiologists and YNP staff, we developed SBDC Minimum Information Guidelines, a set of core data and metadata elements necessary for documenting the context of geobiology data collection in the field. These include (but are not limited to) each sample’s location in relation to a hot spring’s vent; the temperature and pH of the water collected with each sample; field photographs; and more.

Though this initial workflow is specific to the field of geobiology -- and indeed, Dr. Fouke's particular field practices -- we are working with other researchers in other fields to document their research and curation workflows as well, and we hope that the resulting workflows can be altered and used by others.
