# Metadata for Research Data Curation: Design, Select, and Adapt

A central aspect of the data curation enterprise is the design, selection, and adaptation of metadata standards. Metadata often drives the indexing and search functions of the systems we build, and it will act as a communicative device between potential data users and the original data producers. The opening session of this lecture will give a broad overview covering the types of metadata that are used in data curation, and some example use cases. We will focus a good deal of our attention on the preservation metadata standard PREMIS and its relation to research data preservation.
