# Introduction to Data Curation

In parallel with the lowered cost of computing, and the rise of networked information communication technologies (ICTs) - digital data have become a critical information object in our everyday lives: Our phones, our social networks, and our cars all transmit and consume data making it possible for things like GPS to tell us where we are and how we are going to get there. 

Digital data produced by research in the humanities, and science & engineering has, similarly, become an important aspect of scholarship. Just as our phones and cars depend on data to get us where we are going safely, scholars depend on access to, and preservation of their data in order to produce reliable knowledge.  

Archives, Museums, and Libraries have responded to the stewardship and preservation of these digital products by developing data curation services.  

The goal of this workshop is to provide you a working knowledge of the concepts, tools, and approaches to *doing* data curation. In understanding the foundations of data curation - as it cuts across different disciplines and domains - you will be better prepared to make decisions about the costs and benefits of offering data curation services in your own institutional settings. 

An important first step in this process is to broadly define what is we mean when we talk about data curation, and what it is that we do NOT mean.    

To begin, we find it helpful to tease apart the "data" and the "curation" aspects of "data curation."

### What do we mean by data?

In the research contexts, data can mean different things in different people. A humanist may treat a collection of digitized maps as a source of data, while an ecologists might be concerned with geo-location data in the form of latitude and longitude.

In this workshop, rather than assuming that data is a distinct type of artifact (i.e. a map, a database, a digital document) we consider data to be a role - one that is capable of being played by many different types of artifacts.

In the library, archives and museums setting, research data are information objects playing an **evidential role** - they are the resources that scholars draw upon to support their claims, and verify their observations or experimental findings.   

In short, we will rely upon the following definition: 

> Research data are information objects that scholars draw upon for evidence in supporting their findings, and producing new knowledge. 

Note that in this definition we do not make a distinction about data being digital; research data could include any number of physical objects, such as a biological specimen, an architectural blue print, a paper map, etc.

Although the focus of this workshop will be on the curation of digital data there are times when it is necessary to consider how digital data are, and should be linked to physical data. (We will discuss these issues in sessions related to provenance and workflow technologies.) 

### What kinds of evidential roles do data play?

In research data curation it is also important to make a distinction about the different evidential roles that data can play, namely scientific and humanistic. 

**Humanistic Data**

It may initially seem awkward to assume that humanists have data. In the humanities, and the rapidly developing field of Digital Humanities, data support certain operations, and certain interpretations that are ultimately assigned meaning by specific communities (Munoz, 2014). To put this another way, humanities data are propositions that are systematically asserted as encoded symbol structures (Dubin, et al. 2011). It is in this sense that a map may have an evidential value for a humanist to build an argument around. The map - in another context - may simply be a wall decoration... 

Humanities data may take digital forms that range greatly in size and complexity - from single authored TEI - encoded texts, to large collections and corpora of manuscripts, images, cad models, and sound. 

**Scientific data** 

Scientific data is encoded and described with the aim of supporting retrieval, meaningful interpretation, use, and reuse (Wickett et al. 2012). This includes digitized physical materials (e.g. specimens, core samples, chemical analyses) as well as born-digital data (e.g. databases, sequenced DNA, streamed sensor data). The verifiability, and validity of a new knowledge claim within most scientific domains is often dependent upon access to underlying data - which makes the curation of this material a vital part of contemporary scientific practice.  

While these are not the only two evidential roles that research data take, they are the most dominant and most important for a foundation in data curation ... 

### What do we mean by curation?

Curation has traditionally meant the stewardship, preservation, and meaningful arrangement of material collections. Over time the concept has been transferred from the context of physical specimens found in natural history museums or the thematic collections of art, to a digital environment where the curatorial roles of stewardship, preservation and meaningful arrangement have taken on new meanings (Weber et al, 2013). 

In a scholarly environment curatorial roles include developing indexing systems, metadata standards, ontologies, and retrieval systems that will make it possible for research data to work in concert with existing digital libraries, archives, and repositories (Palmer, Renear and Cragin, 2007). Increasingly, this work is aimed at improving data quality, guaranteeing authentication of digital resources throughout a lifecycle of us e and reuse, and capturing provenance of scholarly activities using workflow technologies.

## Data Curation

Drawing on these concepts, a definition of data curation that we have developed at the University of Illinois' iSchool is the following : 

>Data curation is the active and ongoing management of data throughout its entire lifecycle of interest and usefulness to scholarship, including it's reuse in unanticipated contexts (Cragin et al. 2007)

Building off of this definition, Muñoz and Flanders offer a careful explanation of some of these concepts:  

**Active and ongoing management:** 

> Data curators intervene in the research process in order to translate or migrate data into new formats, to enhance it through additional layers of context or markup, to create connections between data sets, and to otherwise ensure that data is maintained in as highly-functional a form as possible.

**Entire lifecycle:** 

> As we enter the era of thoroughly digital research, the full lifecycle of digital research data is still not yet known to us. However, we can anticipate that some data (particularly data collected through destructive means, such as archaeological data) will have a very long horizon of usefulness (in addition to increased evidentiary value for historical analysis and stewardship of our cultural heritage). The uses of data will likely change over time and with different stages of research.

**Interest and usefulness to scholarship:** 

> The term "scholarship" should be construed broadly, especially since data creation, use, and curation are not limited to the academy. Data curation seeks to retain the interest and usefulness of any data that has a serious purpose to fulfill. Furthermore, even for data created and curated within the academy, it is worth remarking that there may be potential user communities outside the academy that could provide valuable motivation and even resources for the curation process. Especially given the recent and increasing emphasis on crowd-sourcing, community-driven data, and the permeability of the boundary between the academy and the public sphere, it is reasonable to anticipate that definitions of "scholarship" may continue to broaden rather than narrow over time.

##Frequently Asked Questions

### Differences between digital and data curation

The two terms are often used interchangeably, but there are important differences to keep in mind when writing and speaking about curation. Digital curation is, or has become, a term that better accommodates a broader range of digital material than research data. It does not indicate what is being curated nor does it necessarily imply which communities can be purposefully served by curatorial activities. Data curation, on the other hand, relates directly to data that is produced and used by scholarly communities, and it facilitates the reuse and repurposing of data to meet new research needs. As Renear and Muñoz aptly put it, “Data curation addresses the challenge of maintaining digital information that is produced in the course of research in a manner that preserves its meaning and usefulness as a potential input for further research” (2011). 

### Big Data 

Big data has received an intense amount of public attention over the last five years. Like data curation, big data can mean many different things to many different communities. A helpful definition offered by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes for Health (NIH) in the USA is as follows:

> ‘Big data ... refers to large, diverse, complex, longitudinal, and/or distributed data sets generated from instruments, sensors, Internet transactions, email, video, click streams, and/or all other digital sources available.

An equally popular and oft-cited explanation of data big data in the private sector is: 

> ‘Big data’ is high volume, high velocity and high variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing[.]

As Dr. Hanna Wallach explains, "...volume refers to the amount of data in question, velocity refers to the speed with which that data can be obtained and/or processed, while variety refers to the range of different data types and sources." (2014)

For the most part, this workshop will provide a foundation for data curation that is helpful, but by no means unique to big data curation.
