A precise definition of data curation was developed by the Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS) at the University of Illinois: 

>the active and ongoing management of data throughout its entire lifecycle of interest and usefulness to scholarship (Cragin et al. 2007)



## Learning Objectives 

1.	Improve understanding of and familiarity with data management life cycles.2.	Gain hands-on experience with developing data management plans associated with sponsored projects, with an eye toward risk and sustainability3.	Learn to select and assess data management tools and repository systems for different disciplines for the purpose of sharing collections4.	Ability to select and adapt standards for data management and utilize existing tools5.	Use tools and approaches for data storage and access as well as understanding the inherent contextual frameworks, limitations and opportunity6.	Improve understanding and contextualizing of digital objects and accounting for data provenance7.	Participants will gain hands-on exposure to contextual data metadata schema design and learn how they support curation
