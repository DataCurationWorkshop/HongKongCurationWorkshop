#About the Data Curation Spring Institute

Data curation plays an increasingly important role in scholarship and education. The first Data Curation Spring Institute in Hong Kong aims to meet the increasing need in expanding capability in data curation and related theories, techniques and best practice in Hong Kong and neighboring regions. It is co-organized by the Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS) in the University of Illinois and the Faculty of Education in the University of Hong Kong (HKU). The event is coordinated by Joint University Librarians Advisory Committee (JULAC) of Hong Kong.
 
The Spring Institute is held in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Library, on February 25-27, 2015. This 3-day intensive training program includes lectures, hands-on laboratory sessions, and case study/discussion sessions. It has attracted over 70 information professionals from Hong Kong, Mainland China, Macau, Taiwan and Singapore. Participants work in diversified domains including humanities, social sciences and sciences. Through the Spring Institute, we expect all participants to enrich their understanding of the latest development in data curation, and expand their capacity to work with researchers and administrators on policies, strategies, procedures and techniques in preserving and making the best use of research data.

#Acknowledgements 

This Spring Institute is generously supported by the Center for Informatics Research in Science and Scholarship (CIRSS) in Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS) in the University of Illinois, Faculty of Education in the University of Hong Kong and the Joint University Librarians Advisory Committee (JULAC) of Hong Kong.

We would like to show our greatest gratitude to the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) Library for providing the venue and local arrangement. Without their support, the Spring Institute would not be successful.

We would also like to acknowledge the generous support provided by the following colleagues: Ms. Diana Chan, University Librarian of HKUST and vice chair of JULAC and Ms. Venia Mak, Head of Access Services at HKUST Library, for helping initiating and conceptualizing the Spring Institute. We would like to expand our deepest appreciation to Mr. Peter Sidorko, the University Librarian of HKU and chair of JULAC for his support for this event. 
  
Besides, special thanks go to Ms. Alice Ho, Administrative Services Manager of HKUST for her detailed work on local arrangement. Our thanks should also be extended to Ms. Linda Lee, JULAC Manager and Ms. Mary Chiu for serving as the registration administrators. We also need to thank many HKUST colleagues for providing various kinds of support. Finally we would like to thank all JULAC members for making suggestions on the content and topics covered in the Spring Institute. 

The NYPL portion of the "Open Refine" lab was created at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities and developed through the Digital Humanities Data Curation Institute series, generously funded by the National Endowment of the Humanities.

The SBDC Case Study is funded by Institute of Museum and Library Service National Leadership Grant number LG-06-12-0706-12. The SBDC project is a collaboration among information scientists, data archiving experts, geobiologists, and site resource managers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Washington, Johns Hopkins University, and Yellowstone National Park. This presentation summarizes work conducted by the SBDC Team since 2012. Team members include: Carole Palmer (PI), Bruce Fouke, G. Sayeed Choudhury, Ann Rodman, Karen Baker, Jacob Jett, Abigail Asangba, Karen Wickett, Sean Gordon, and Christie Hendrix. Dr. Wickett in particular has been instrumental in developing the process modeling approach described here.
