# About the Data Curation Spring Institute

Data curation nowadays play an important role in scholarship and education. The first Data Curation Spring Institute in Hong Kong aims to meet the increasing need in expanding capability in data curation and related theories, techniques and best practice in Hong Kong and neighboring regions. It is co-organized by the Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS) in the University of Illinois and the Faculty of Education in the University of Hong Kong (HKU). The event is coordinated by Joint University Librarians Advisory Committee (JULAC) of Hong Kong.
 
The Spring Institute is held in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Library, on February 25-27, 2015. This 3-day intensive training program includes lectures, hands-on laboratory sessions, and case study/discussion sessions. It has attracted over 70 information professionals from Hong Kong, Mainland China, Macau, Taiwan and Singapore. Participants work in diversified domains including humanities, social sciences and sciences. Through the Spring Institute, we expect all participants to enrich their understanding of the latest development in data curation, and expand their capacity to work with researchers and administrators to come up with policies, strategies, procedures and techniques in preserving and making the best use of the research data.
